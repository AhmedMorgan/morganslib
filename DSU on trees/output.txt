the number of primes under 100000000: 5761455
the number of primes under 100000000 and at form 4k + 1: 2880504
the number of primes under 100000000 and at form 4k + 3: 2880950
we find that the number of primes of form 4k + 1 plus the primes of form 4k + 3 nearly equal to the total number of prims under n
